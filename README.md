# Genomes-and-Gentic-disorder-in-children

Sequence of steps to follow to run our code
1. The platform used to create this model is google colab, it is prefered to run on the same.
colab Link for the model : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17ByGsg-XT1xmeILprWpE0T_wcvJNJM4v?usp=sharing
Dataset link from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/aryarishabh/of-genomes-and-genetics-hackerearth-ml-challenge?select=train.csv
2. We have used github repo as a place to store our dataset online
but the token to use it expires 7 days once
Therefore inorder to run it, manually upload the train.csv renamed as gene_data.csv
2. All the code cells written with proper documentation and text cell structing
3.Follow the same sequence while executing ie is starting with Data preprocessung and ending with Hyper parameter tuning.
4.Aditionally RFE(recursive feature extraction) with Random Forest has been tried out in the end(additional approach), eventhough we have used PCA for all models in the code.
